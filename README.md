# Multilingual-NLP-Research-Reasoning-Project-Exercise
This is the exercise I completed for the Reasoning Project as a part of my application to the Multilingual NLP Research group at the University of Maryland.
To run the Jupyter notebook on your own, simply go to Google Colab and in the content folder, upload the reasoning_data folder from the repository.
You can also change the DIR_PATH variable in the first code block if you'd prefer a custom folder path.
